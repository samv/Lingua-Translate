Lingua::Translate version 0.05
==============================

This module performs natural language translation using Babelfish
(http://altavista.babelfish.com/) or Systran (http://www.systran.org/)

If the test suite (`make test') fails, it may be because Babelfish is
overloaded, down or unreachable.  I'm in two minds as to whether or
not this is a bug :-).  Given that most users won't have a configured
SysTran server available, the test script for that works in a
different way and doesn't have the same problem.

INSTALLATION ON A DEBIAN SYSTEM

    apt-get install build-essential fakeroot

 2. Build the package; this may/should be done as a normal user

    dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc -rfakeroot

 3. Install the generated package

    dpkg -i ../liblingua-translate-perl_0.05_all.deb

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

Core Functionality:
   Pod::Constants, 0.15 or later.
   Unicode::MapUTF8

Lingua::Translate::Babelfish backend:
   HTML::TokeParser
   LWP::UserAgent

Lingua::Translate::SysTran backend:
   IO::Socket::INET (standard)

The module will cope without Unicode::MapUTF8, but no attempt will be
made to convert strings passed to and from the back end - the
Babelfish back-end uses UTF-8, whereas the SysTran back-end uses
ISO-8859-1.
